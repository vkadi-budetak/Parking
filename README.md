# 🚗 Car Parking Management System (Java Core)

A console-based application designed to simulate the operations of a parking lot management system. This project was developed as part of my intensive training to master **Java Core** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

⚠️ **Status:** Educational Prototype / Active Development.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate a deep understanding of the Java language syntax, memory management, and class architecture without relying on external frameworks like Spring (yet).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java 17
* **Concepts:** OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)
* **Data Structures:** Java Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap)
* **Interface:** Console (CLI)

## ✨ Features
* **Vehicle Registration:** Ability to register different types of vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Motorcycles).
* **Parking Logic:** Automatic allocation of available slots based on vehicle type.
* **Fee Calculation:** Logic to calculate parking fees based on duration (simulated).
* **In-Memory Storage:** Data is currently stored in memory (Java Collections) to demonstrate state management.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the project** in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3.  **Navigate** to the `src` folder and find the `Main.java` class.
4.  **Run** the `Main` class to start the console interaction.

## 🔜 Future Improvements (To-Do)
As I continue my studies at AIT TR, I plan to upgrade this project:
* [ ] Add **JUnit** tests to ensure code reliability.
* [ ] Integrate a **Database** (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for persistent data storage.
* [ ] Refactor into a Web Application using **Spring Boot**.
